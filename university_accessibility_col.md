> Higher education faces several challenges in Latin America, such as access inequality, low enrollment rates, a mismatch between specialties offered and the needs of the labor market, and low graduation rates ([^~[Dudziak, 2007](http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0123-34322019000100013#B16)~]; [^~[Holm-Nielsen, Thorn, Brunner & Balán, 2005](http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0123-34322019000100013#B25)~]). Due to inequalities in access to education, many students do not receive sufficient preparation in academic literacies to succeed in higher education ([^~[Holm-Nielsen, et al., 2005](http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0123-34322019000100013#B25)~]). Furthermore, universities often reproduce access inequalities by favoring students who have had the privilege of attending private schools.

* Access inequality in universities is simply another form of the rooted social inequality.
* People with the average, meager funds cannot access private universities – it's ostentatiously and unfairly expensive.
* Private universities' admission is solely based on stratification and selection over a raised and steep financial threshold.
* Behind a financial and social classification, private universities don't evaluate applicant's knowledge and skills, which should be primordial. And the high-school and ICFES scores evaluation is merely a facade 'to assess' their applicants' reputation.
* The private universities' emphasis is in showing off their infrastructure and allegeded opportunities of professional development.
